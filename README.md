Audio Atlas

Audio Atlas is an interactive sound map, like a kind of "Google Maps Street Sound".
Users can search for any city on a Leaflet map and play a location related soundscape. The app demonstrates fetch from Nominatim (OpenStreetMap API) for geolocation and integrates Freesound audio samples to create an immersive sensory experience.
