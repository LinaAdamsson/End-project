# Project description
AUDIO ATLAS – An interactive sound map, a kind of Google Maps for your ears which lets you listen to the world. Users can search for any city on a Leaflet map and play a location related soundscape. The app demonstrates fetch from Nominatim (OpenStreetMap API) for geolocation and integrates Freesound audio samples to create an immersive sensory experience.

# End-project
Build a single-page or multi-page web app that retrieves data from one or more public web APIs using fetch.
